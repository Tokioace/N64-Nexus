# Retro HomeScreen Implementation

## Overview
A new retro-style HomeScreen component (`HomeScreenRetro.tsx`) has been implemented, inspired by Mario Kart 64 and Super Mario 64 UI design. The component features animated floating tiles with a polygonal, N64-era aesthetic.

- **Navigation Tiles** (4-6 compact squares)
  - Quiz, Minigames, Leaderboard, Profile, Events, Media
  - Individual hover animations (wiggle, pulse, rotate)
  - Staggered animation delays for visual appeal

### ✅ Technical Implementation

├── index.css                        # Updated with retro tile styles
└── App.tsx                          # Updated with /retro route
```

## CSS Classes Added

### Tile Base Classes
- `.retro-tile` - Base tile styling with 3D effects
- `.retro-tile-news` - News feed tile (yellow gradient)
- `.retro-tile-event` - Event info tile (red gradient)
- `.retro-tile-small` - Navigation tiles (various colors)

### Animation Classes
- `@keyframes float` - Floating animation for tiles
- `@keyframes wiggle` - Subtle wiggle for small tiles
- `@keyframes iconPulse` - Icon pulsing animation
- `@keyframes spinSlow` - Slow rotation for N64 button
- `@keyframes logoGlow` - Glowing text effect

### Responsive Features
- Mobile-optimized tile sizes
- Proper touch targets (min 44px)
- Responsive grid layouts
- Optimized animations for mobile performance

## Usage

### Accessing Retro HomeScreen
1. Navigate to `/retro` directly
2. Click the floating N64 button on the classic HomePage
3. Click the N64 button on the retro screen to return to classic view

### Customization
- Tile colors can be modified in the CSS classes
- Animation timings can be adjusted in the keyframes
- News data can be connected to real API endpoints
- Event data automatically pulls from existing EventContext

## Browser Compatibility
- ✅ iOS Safari (12+)
- ✅ Android Chrome (80+)
- ✅ Desktop Chrome, Firefox, Safari
- ✅ Mobile responsive design
- ✅ Touch-friendly interactions

## Performance Considerations
- CSS animations use `transform` and `opacity` for GPU acceleration
- Staggered animations prevent simultaneous reflows
- Optimized for 60fps on mobile devices
- Minimal JavaScript for animations (CSS-based)

## Future Enhancements
- [ ] Add hover sound effects (mentioned as optional)
- [ ] Connect news feed to real API
- [ ] Add more tile types for additional features
- [ ] Implement tile customization/reordering
- [ ] Add particle effects for enhanced retro feel
