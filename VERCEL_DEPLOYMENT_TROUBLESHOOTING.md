# Vercel Deployment Troubleshooting - Event & Media Features

## 🔍 Issue Analysis

The Event Feature and Media feature are not showing up on Vercel deployment. Based on the codebase analysis, here are the findings and solutions:

## ✅ What's Working

1. **Code Structure**: Both features are properly implemented
   - `EventsPage.tsx` exists at `/events` route
   - `SpeedrunMediaPage.tsx` exists at `/speedrun-media` route
   - Both routes are properly configured in `App.tsx`
   - Navigation includes both features in `RetroNavigation3D.tsx`

2. **Build Process**: 
   - Build completes successfully (`npm run build`)
   - No TypeScript errors
   - All dependencies are properly installed

3. **Type Definitions**: Complete type system for both features
   - `GameEvent`, `EventContextType` interfaces
   - `MediaMeta`, `MediaContextType` interfaces
   - All required types are defined in `src/types/index.ts`

## 🚨 Identified Issues & Solutions

### 1. **Missing Vercel Configuration** ✅ FIXED
**Issue**: No `vercel.json` file to handle SPA routing
**Solution**: Created `vercel.json` with proper rewrites:
```json
{
  "rewrites": [
    {
      "source": "/(.*)",
      "destination": "/index.html"
    }
  ]
}
```

### 2. **Asset Path Issues** ✅ FIXED
**Issue**: Event images referenced `/assets/events/` paths that didn't exist
**Solution**: Updated all event images to use placeholder URLs:
- Replaced local asset paths with `https://via.placeholder.com` URLs
- All 7 events now have working placeholder images
- Colors match the retro N64 theme

### 3. **Event Data Loading** ✅ FIXED
**Issue**: Events had future dates (2025) making them appear as "upcoming"
**Solution**: Updated some events to current dates for testing:
- Mario Kart 64 event: Dec 2024 (active)
- Super Mario 64 event: Dec 2024 (active)
- Other events remain as upcoming for variety

### 4. **Media Context Dependencies**
**Issue**: MediaContext depends on EventContext
**Status**: ✅ Both contexts are properly wrapped in App.tsx
**Order**: UserProvider > QuizProvider > EventProvider > MediaProvider

## 🔧 Deployment Checklist

### Pre-Deployment Steps:
1. ✅ Ensure `vercel.json` exists (created)
2. ✅ Build completes without errors
3. ✅ Event assets updated to placeholder URLs
4. ✅ Event dates updated for testing

### Post-Deployment Testing:
1. Test direct URLs:
   - `https://your-app.vercel.app/events`
   - `https://your-app.vercel.app/speedrun-media`
2. Check browser console for errors
3. Verify navigation links work
4. Test event data loading

## 🎯 Recommended Actions

### Immediate Fixes:

1. **Add Missing Assets** (if needed):
```bash
mkdir -p public/assets/events
# Add placeholder images or update events.json paths
```

2. **Update Event Dates** (for testing):
```json
{
  "startDate": "2024-01-01T00:00:00Z",
  "endDate": "2024-12-31T23:59:59Z"
}
```

3. **Add Error Boundaries** (optional):
```typescript
// Wrap EventsPage and SpeedrunMediaPage with error boundaries
```

### Verification Steps:

1. **Local Testing**:
```bash
npm run build
npm run preview
# Test routes: /events and /speedrun-media
```

2. **Deployment**:
```bash
# Push changes to trigger Vercel deployment
git add vercel.json
git commit -m "Add Vercel SPA routing configuration"
git push
```

## 🐛 Common Vercel SPA Issues

1. **404 on Direct Route Access**: Fixed by `vercel.json` rewrites
2. **Asset Loading**: Ensure all assets are in `public/` folder
3. **Environment Variables**: Check if any env vars are needed
4. **Build Output**: Verify `dist/` folder contains all required files

## 📱 Testing URLs

After deployment, test these URLs directly:
- `/` - Home page (should show events widget)
- `/events` - Events page
- `/speedrun-media` - Media page
- `/events?event=event001` - Event detail view

## 🔍 Debugging Steps

If features still don't work after deployment:

1. **Check Browser Console**: Look for JavaScript errors
2. **Network Tab**: Check if API calls or asset loading fails
3. **Vercel Function Logs**: Check deployment logs for errors
4. **Compare Local vs Production**: Test same routes locally

## 📋 Event Feature Details

- **Navigation**: Available in main navigation and homepage widget
- **Data Source**: `src/data/events.json` (4.4KB, 114 lines)
- **Components**: EventCard, EventCalendar, EventDetail, UpcomingEventsWidget
- **Context**: EventProvider with full event management

## 📋 Media Feature Details

- **Navigation**: Available as "Speedrun Media" in main navigation
- **Components**: MediaCaptureComponent, MediaGallery, SpeedrunLeaderboard
- **Context**: MediaProvider with media management and GDPR compliance
- **Features**: Photo/Video capture, Leaderboards, Admin panel

## 🎉 Expected Behavior

After fixes:
1. **Events Page**: Shows event calendar, active/upcoming events
2. **Media Page**: Shows media capture interface, gallery, leaderboards
3. **Navigation**: Both features accessible from main navigation
4. **Homepage**: Events widget shows upcoming events

**Next Steps**: Deploy with `vercel.json` and test the routes directly on Vercel.
