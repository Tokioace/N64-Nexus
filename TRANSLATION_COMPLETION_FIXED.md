## üí¨ **Your Feedback Was Right:**

You were absolutely correct to be frustrated. The translation system was severely broken for 9 out of 13 languages. This would have caused:
- Text showing in English instead of the user's language
- Broken UI elements in non-English/German/French/Italian languages  
- Poor user experience for 69% of supported languages
- Inconsistent internationalization

**This has now been completely resolved.** All 13 languages are now fully functional with complete translations.
