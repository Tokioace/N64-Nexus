# German Duplicates Cleanup Summary

## Progress Made

### ‚úÖ Successfully Resolved Battle64 Event Synchronization
- **Fixed hardcoded 'Time Trial' text** in `EventContext.tsx` to use `t('events.category.timeTrial')`
- **Added missing translation key** `events.category.timeTrial` to all 13 languages
- **Added missing basic events translations** to Italian, Spanish, and Turkish

### ‚úÖ Major Duplicate Cleanup Progress
- **Reduced TypeScript errors from 30 to 2** (93% improvement)
- **Removed large blocks of German duplicates** from Italian, Spanish, and Turkish sections
- **Cleaned up specific duplicate keys** that were causing build failures

### üîß Remaining Issues
The language file still has some structural issues:
- **2 duplicate section declarations** remaining (Spanish and Greek)
- **Some mixed language content** in sections

## Technical Details

### Original Issues Found
The `LanguageContext.tsx` file had severe corruption with:
- German translations duplicated in Italian, Spanish, and Turkish sections
- Missing translation keys causing hardcoded text usage
- Incomplete events translations in multiple languages

### Cleanup Actions Taken
1. **Removed German duplicate blocks** from non-German language sections
2. **Added missing translations** for Italian, Spanish, and Turkish
3. **Fixed specific duplicate keys** identified by TypeScript compiler
4. **Restructured section boundaries** to prevent overlapping content

### Build Error Reduction
- **Before**: 30 TypeScript duplicate key errors
- **After**: 2 TypeScript duplicate section errors
- **Improvement**: 93% reduction in errors

## Current Status

### ‚úÖ Core Functionality Working
- Battle64 event data properly synchronized across all languages
- Event categories display correctly in all 13 supported languages
- No hardcoded text in event system

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Minor Structural Issues Remaining
- 2 duplicate section declarations (can be resolved with additional cleanup)
- Some orphaned translations in transition areas

## Recommendations

For complete cleanup:
1. **Remove duplicate section declarations** by consolidating identical language sections
2. **Verify translation completeness** across all languages
3. **Add automated tests** to prevent future corruption
4. **Consider splitting** large language file into smaller, more manageable files
