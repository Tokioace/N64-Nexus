fix(vercel): serve static assets before SPA fallback + routes-only config to stop 401 and mount crash

- Replace mixed rewrites/headers with routes-only configuration
- Filesystem-first serving, then fallback to /index.html
- Add caching headers for sw.js, manifest.json, assets/static/icons/splash via routes
- Prevent 401 on vendor chunks (icons-vendor, map-vendor, manifest) that caused React import to be undefined and forwardRef crash
- Build verified; app mounts past loader
