# App Startup Fix Summary

## Issue Identified
The application was failing to start due to a missing context provider in the React component hierarchy.

## Root Cause
The `Layout` component (and several other components) were trying to use the `usePoints` hook from `PointsContext`, but the `PointsProvider` was not included in the provider hierarchy in `App.tsx`.

## Fix Applied
Added the missing `PointsProvider` to the React context provider hierarchy in `src/App.tsx`:

```tsx
// Added import
import { PointsProvider } from './contexts/PointsContext'

// Added to provider hierarchy
<LanguageProvider>
  <UserProvider>
    <PointsProvider>  // ← Added this provider
      <QuizProvider>
        <EventProvider>
          <MediaProvider>
            <ForumProvider>
              <Layout>
                {/* Routes */}
              </Layout>
            </ForumProvider>
          </MediaProvider>
        </EventProvider>
      </QuizProvider>
    </PointsProvider>
  </UserProvider>
</LanguageProvider>
```

## Components Affected
The following components were failing due to the missing PointsProvider:
- `Layout.tsx` - Main layout component
- `PointsWidget.tsx` - Points display widget
- `AchievementsPanel.tsx` - Achievements display
- `N64FanLeaderboard.tsx` - Leaderboard component
- `PointsOverview.tsx` - Points overview component
- Various page components that use points functionality

## Additional Setup Required
1. Install dependencies: `npm install`
2. Start development server: `npm run dev`
3. Build for production: `npm run build`

## Files Modified
- `src/App.tsx` - Added PointsProvider import and wrapped in provider hierarchy

## Status
✅ Fixed - The app should now start without the context provider error.
