## Possible Causes of Preview Not Updating

### 1. **Branch/Deployment Mismatch**
- Preview may be pointing to wrong branch
- Vercel might be deploying from cached commit

### 2. **Build Cache Issues**
- Vercel build cache preventing new deployment
- Static assets not being regenerated

### 3. **Git Integration Problems**
- Webhook not triggering properly
- GitHub-Vercel connection issues

### 4. **Environment Configuration**
- Wrong environment variables
- Build configuration conflicts

## Recommended Solutions

### üöÄ Immediate Actions

#### 1. Force New Deployment
```bash
# If Vercel CLI is available
npm install -g vercel
vercel --prod --force

# Or trigger via git
git commit --allow-empty -m "Force Vercel redeploy"
git push origin main
```

#### 2. Clear Build Cache
- Go to Vercel Dashboard ‚Üí Project Settings
- Navigate to "Build & Development Settings"
- Enable "Clear Build Cache"
- Trigger new deployment

#### 3. Check Deployment Status
- Visit Vercel Dashboard
- Check latest deployment logs
- Verify which commit is being deployed
- Ensure correct branch is configured

### üîß Configuration Verification

#### 1. Verify Vercel.json Configuration
Current configuration looks correct:
```json
{
  "buildCommand": "npm run build",
  "outputDirectory": "dist",
  "framework": "vite",
  "rewrites": [
    {
      "source": "/(.*)",
      "destination": "/index.html"
    }
  ]
}
```

#### 2. Check Git Integration
- Verify GitHub repository connection
- Ensure production branch is set to `main`
- Check webhook delivery in GitHub settings

#### 3. Environment Variables
- Ensure all required environment variables are set
- Check if any new variables are needed for the menu

### üéØ Testing the New Menu

#### Access Points:
1. **Direct URL**: Visit `/retro` on the preview domain
2. **Toggle Button**: Click the floating N64 button on homepage
3. **Navigation**: Use React Router navigation

#### Expected Behavior:
- Retro tiles with N64-style animations
- Expandable news feed
- Live event information
- Sound effects on interactions
- Responsive design on mobile

### üîç Debugging Steps

#### 1. Check Build Logs
```bash
# Look for build errors or warnings
# Check if all dependencies are installed
# Verify TypeScript compilation
```

#### 2. Verify Routes
- Ensure `/retro` route is accessible
- Check React Router configuration
- Test navigation between views

#### 3. Component Dependencies
- Verify all imports are resolved
- Check if `RetroSoundEffects` component exists
- Ensure context providers are available

## Next Steps

### Priority 1: Immediate Fix
1. **Clear Vercel build cache**
2. **Force new deployment**
3. **Test preview URL directly**

### Priority 2: Verification
1. **Check deployment logs**
2. **Verify branch configuration**
3. **Test menu functionality**

### Priority 3: Prevention
1. **Set up deployment monitoring**
2. **Configure proper webhooks**
3. **Document deployment process**

## Technical Details

### New Files Added:
- `src/components/HomeScreenRetro.tsx` - Main retro menu component
- `RETRO_HOMESCREEN_README.md` - Documentation
- `VERCEL_DEPLOYMENT_FIXED.md` - Previous deployment fixes

### Routes Modified:
- `src/App.tsx` - Added `/retro` route
- `src/pages/HomePage.tsx` - Added toggle button

### Styles Added:
- Retro tile animations in `src/index.css`
- N64-style color palette and effects
- Mobile-responsive design

## Conclusion

The new menu (Men√º) was successfully implemented and merged. The Vercel preview issue is likely due to deployment cache or configuration problems rather than code issues. Following the recommended solutions should resolve the preview update problem and make the new retro menu visible.
